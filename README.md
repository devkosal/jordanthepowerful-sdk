# jordanthepowerful-sdk
An SDK for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy API 

# Purpose 
This is to be a wrapper around an existing API that will hopefully encapsulate dand decouple logic in way that makes it easier for the future engineers 

# Scope 
I am only handling the movie and the qoute parts of the API if you require additional functionality, well , that sucks for you. 

# Setup
Just like most packages its just "npm install jordanthepowerful-sdk"

# Testing 
I was not getting paid enough when building this to do test driven development, please use at your own risk. 

# Contributing 
If you feel this could be better please submit PRs or Fork it!
